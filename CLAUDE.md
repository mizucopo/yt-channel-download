# Git Flow

## WHY
Adopt a simple branching strategy to balance parallel development and quality assurance in team collaboration.
Minimize impact on production while enabling independent feature development.

## WHAT
- main: Production (production-ready code)
- develop: Development (integration branch for features)
- feature/*: Features (branch from develop, merge to develop)
- release/*: Not used
- hotfix/*: Not used

## HOW
```bash
# Start feature development
git checkout develop && git pull
git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>

# Create pull request
gh pr create --base develop
```

## Directory Structure

```
- src/ - Domain logic
- stubs/ - Type stub files
- tests/ - Test code
```

## Code Organization Rules

### WHY
Maintain consistent structure to ensure readability, maintainability, and testability.
Follow single responsibility principle to minimize scope of changes.

### WHAT
- One class per file
- One test file per class
- Keep `__init__.py` files empty
- Never modify pyproject.toml when fixing linting errors

### HOW
- Create a new file when adding a new class
- Name test files as `test_<filename>.py`
- Fix lint errors in code, never relax configuration
- Place imports at the top of the file, never in the middle
- Use `git mv` for file moves
- Use `git rm` for file deletions

## Testing Guidelines (Strict Adherence)

### WHY
Tests are executable documentation of specifications and a safety net against regressions.
Test behavior, not implementation details, to prevent test breakage during refactoring.

### WHAT
- **Framework**: Use function-based tests (pytest), not class-based
- **Language**: Write test comments (especially AAA steps) and docstrings in Japanese to clarify intent
- **Strategy**: Test "What" (observable behavior/results), not "How" (implementation details)
- **Mocking**: Minimize mocks. Use real instances for domain logic; mock only external boundaries (DB, API, SMTP)
- **Architecture**: Separate domain logic from IO. Use Humble Object/Hexagonal patterns for testability
- **Scope**: Never test private methods directly. Cover them indirectly via public interfaces

### HOW
- Structure with **AAA Pattern** (Arrange, Act, Assert) and explicit comments
- **Naming**: Describe business requirements (e.g., `sum_of_two_numbers_returns_total_value`)
- **File placement**: Mirror source module structure in `tests/` directory
- **Docstring style**: Use passive voice ("〜こと" form) consistently
  - Title: "〜を検証" → "〜されること", "〜が〜されること"
  - When: "〜を選択", "〜を実行" → "〜が選択され", "〜が実行される"
  - Then: "〜を返す", "〜が生成" → "〜が返されること", "〜が生成されること"

## Quality Check

### WHY
Verify code quality and detect unexpected behavior before committing.
Ensure continuous quality assurance through automated testing.

### WHAT
- Run test suite
- Verify test coverage

### HOW
```bash
uv run task test
```
